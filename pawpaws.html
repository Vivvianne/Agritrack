    <h1>Pawpaws</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="container">
            <p>Papaya (Carica papaya) is a perennial fruit tree widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates for its nutritive and medicinal values. It is very popular in Kenya where it is grown for both local and export markets.
                    Pawpaw is widely cultivated fruit tree in the tropics and subtropics. It is grown in Kenya as a domestic fruit and small-scale cash crop. The fruits are low in calories and rich in vitamins A, B1, B2 & C, iron and potassium. Papayas enzymes promote digestion easing constipation. Sale of fresh papaya provides regular income for farmers since the fruits are produced through out the year.

        <h2>Utilization</h2>
        <p>Pawpaw fruits are sold and eaten locally as fresh fruit, with high demand from the hotels, local grocery, fruit salad vendors, supermarkets and export market. The fruits are dried and exported as part of a dried fruit mixture.
                It can be used to make ice-cream flavour, refreshing drinks, jam, jelly, wine, marmalade, candies and crystallized fruits.
                The latex produced by the unripe fruit is harvested and used in the production of papain, used in the brewing industry, canned meats and pharmaceutical industries.
                Green fruits are pickled or cooked as a vegetable.
                Young leaves are sometimes eaten as vegetables.

        <h2>Polution</h2>
        <p>Pollination is a key component of productivity that also plays a role in determining fruit set and fruit quality. Hence it is important to balance the tree types.</p>

        <h2>Ecological Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>rainfall of above 1000mm is suitable. Irrigation should be done in low rainfall regions.
                </li>
            <li>Soils– the crop does well in light, well drained soils with PH 6-6.5 and rich in nutrients. Roots are very sensitive to waterlogging.
                </li>
            <li>TemperRainfall– papaya cannot withstand prolonged drought. An even distributed annual ature– papaya thrives in warm to hot regions of temperature range of 20-35 degrees centigrade. Fruit is sweeter when grown during warm sunny season.

                <h2>Types of Trees</h2>
                <p>The pawpaw has three tree types based on the flowers are arranged; female, male and hermaphrodite. These can only be differentiated after it flowers. The characteristics are described below:
                    </p>
                    <h4>Pistillate (Female plants)</h4>
                    <p>They produce female flowers only. These are large, situated singly or in clusters near the trunk of the tree and close to the base of the leaf stalk. There are no stamens (Male flowers), so cross pollination is necessary for the fruit to set. They produce good fruits.</p>
                    <h4>Staminate (Male plants)</h4>
                    <p>They produce only male flowers, which are borne in large numbers in long, drooping branches of up to 1m in length. The true male flower produces pollen only and it is essential for the development of fruit from the female flower. Occasionally male plants will produce 2 hermaphrodite flowers and set fruit on the ends of the branches; however, these fruits are usually of poor quality or no fruit production.</p>
                    <h4>Hermaphrodite plants</h4>
                    <p>They produce flowers which have both male and female parts and are capable of self- pollination. Bisexual fruits are usually long and narrow, and although the eating quality may be excellent, the shape presents some problems for commercial handling.</p>
