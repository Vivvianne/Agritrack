      <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Papaya (Carica papaya) is a perennial fruit tree widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates for its nutritive and medicinal values. It is very popular in Kenya where it is grown for both local and export markets.
                    Pawpaw is widely cultivated fruit tree in the tropics and subtropics. It is grown in Kenya as a domestic fruit and small-scale cash crop. The fruits are low in calories and rich in vitamins A, B1, B2 & C, iron and potassium. Papayas enzymes promote digestion easing constipation. Sale of fresh papaya provides regular income for farmers since the fruits are produced through out the year.

        <h2>Utilization</h2>
        <p>Pawpaw fruits are sold and eaten locally as fresh fruit, with high demand from the hotels, local grocery, fruit salad vendors, supermarkets and export market. The fruits are dried and exported as part of a dried fruit mixture.
                It can be used to make ice-cream flavour, refreshing drinks, jam, jelly, wine, marmalade, candies and crystallized fruits.
                The latex produced by the unripe fruit is harvested and used in the production of papain, used in the brewing industry, canned meats and pharmaceutical industries.
                Green fruits are pickled or cooked as a vegetable.
                Young leaves are sometimes eaten as vegetables.

        <h2>Polution</h2>
        <p>Pollination is a key component of productivity that also plays a role in determining fruit set and fruit quality. Hence it is important to balance the tree types.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Ecological Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>rainfall of above 1000mm is suitable. Irrigation should be done in low rainfall regions.
                </li>
            <li>Soils– the crop does well in light, well drained soils with PH 6-6.5 and rich in nutrients. Roots are very sensitive to waterlogging.
                </li>
            <li>TemperRainfall– papaya cannot withstand prolonged drought. An even distributed annual ature– papaya thrives in warm to hot regions of temperature range of 20-35 degrees centigrade. Fruit is sweeter when grown during warm sunny season.
                </li>

     <h2>Pests</h2>
     <h3>Fruit flies</h3>
     <p>The adults deposit their eggs under the skin of mature and ripening fruit. Some fruit flies lay eggs on green pawpaw, but most of the eggs die due to the latex secreted when fruits are punctured by females while laying eggs. The eggs hatch into maggots which feed on the flesh of the fruit causing it to rot. This may cause fruit fall.
         </p>
         <p><b>Management:</b> Spray PENTAGON 50EC 10ml/20l or LEXUS 247SC 8ml/20l or PRESENTO 200SP 5g/20l
             </p>
             <h3>Red spider mites</h3>
             <p>They suck plant sap and this affects the general performance of the plant, e.g., poor plant growth, leaf drop, production of fruits with blemishes, etc.
                     Severe infestations occur during prolonged dry spells.
                     </p>

                         </p>
         <h3>Mealy bugs</h3>
         <p>They suck sap from tender leaves, petioles and fruits. Severely attacked leaves and fruits drop. They also excrete honey dew on which sooty mold develops.
             </p>

             <h3>Thrips
                 </h3>
                 <p>These are sap-sucking insects which attack and puncture shoots, leaves and flower buds as they feed. Severe infestation can cause flower abortion.
                     </p>

 <h2>Nutrition And Nutritional Deficiencies
     </h2>
     <h3>Overview</h3>
     <p>Papaya nutrition is key for a year long high and quality fruit production.
             Both basal and foliar fertilizers should be applied in order to ensure that the plants are supplied with both macro and micronutrient elements..
             Basal fertilizers are absorbed by the plants through the roots and include DAP, CAN, NPK, UREA, among others. Farmyard manure could also be added, depending on the organic matter of the soil.
             Foliar fertilizers are absorbed by the plants through the foliage and include OPTIMIZER, DIMIPHITE, ZINC GOLD, LAVENDER, GATIT SERIES, VITABOR GOLD, among others.
             Sufficient nutrient supply prevent deficiencies which weaken the plants making them susceptible to attack by pathogens.
             </p>
             <h3>Deficiencies
                 </h3>
                 <h4>Phosphorous deficiency
                     </h4>
                     <p>Deficiency stops plant elongation and leaves become irregularly necrotic with a characteristic blue or dark green colour. Production is greatly reduced.

                <h2>Types of Trees</h2>
                <p>The pawpaw has three tree types based on the flowers are arranged; female, male and hermaphrodite. These can only be differentiated after it flowers. The characteristics are described below:
                    </p>
                    <h4>Pistillate (Female plants)</h4>
                    <p>They produce female flowers only. These are large, situated singly or in clusters near the trunk of the tree and close to the base of the leaf stalk. There are no stamens (Male flowers), so cross pollination is necessary for the fruit to set. They produce good fruits.</p>
                    <h4>Staminate (Male plants)</h4>
                    <p>They produce only male flowers, which are borne in large numbers in long, drooping branches of up to 1m in length. The true male flower produces pollen only and it is essential for the development of fruit from the female flower. Occasionally male plants will produce 2 hermaphrodite flowers and set fruit on the ends of the branches; however, these fruits are usually of poor quality or no fruit production.</p>
                    <h4>Hermaphrodite plants</h4>
                    <p>They produce flowers which have both male and female parts and are capable of self- pollination. Bisexual fruits are usually long and narrow, and although the eating quality may be excellent, the shape presents some problems for commercial handling.</p>

        <h2>Types of Trees</h2>
        <p>The pawpaw has three tree types based on the flowers are arranged; female, male and hermaphrodite. These can only be differentiated after it flowers. The characteristics are described below:
            </p>
            <h4>Pistillate (Female plants)</h4>
            <p>They produce female flowers only. These are large, situated singly or in clusters near the trunk of the tree and close to the base of the leaf stalk. There are no stamens (Male flowers), so cross pollination is necessary for the fruit to set. They produce good fruits.</p>
            <h4>Staminate (Male plants)</h4>
            <p>They produce only male flowers, which are borne in large numbers in long, drooping branches of up to 1m in length. The true male flower produces pollen only and it is essential for the development of fruit from the female flower. Occasionally male plants will produce 2 hermaphrodite flowers and set fruit on the ends of the branches; however, these fruits are usually of poor quality or no fruit production.</p>
            <h4>Hermaphrodite plants</h4>
            <p>They produce flowers which have both male and female parts and are capable of self- pollination. Bisexual fruits are usually long and narrow, and although the eating quality may be excellent, the shape presents some problems for commercial handling.</p>
        <div class="container">
                <h4>Raising Seedlings</h4>
                <p>Seeds can be sown directly in the field or first raised in nursery beds, in polythene bags, containers etc.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare a seedbed to a fine tilth.</li>
                <li>Drench soil with a mixture of PYRAMID 700WP 100g+LOYALTY 700WDG 10g+ OPTIMIZER 20ml in 20litres of water. This eradicates soil diseases and pests, breaks seed dormancy, encourages uniform germination and supplies nutrients to the young plants.</li>
                <li>Select seeds from a controlled pollination and dry them. The outer layer of the seed coat can be removed.</li>
                <li>Soak seeds in OPTIMIZER 20ml/1l for 30-60minutes to break seed dormancy.</li>
                <li>Place 4-5 seeds in holes, 1cm deep and 15cm apart and cover with a slight layer of soil.</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Seeds germinate after 2-3weeks.</p>
                <h2>Transplanting</h2>
                <p>Seedlings are transplanted 4-5 weeks after sowing when they have attained 3-4 leaves or 15-20cm height. While transplanting, careful handling is important in order to avoid disturbing the roots.</p>
                <p>Plants grown in a seed bed should first be hardened off.</p>
                <p>In order to prevent transplanting shock, seedlings should be sprayed with OPTIMIZER 10ml/20l.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Prepare planting holes 60cm*60cm, 3 meters apart.</li>
                <li>Mix top soil with manure and DAP and fill the holes with the mixture. To improve on nutrient uptake, root development, stimulate plant growth among other benefits, mix manure (1 ton) or fertilizer (50kg) with HUMIPOWER 1kg.</li>
                <li>Plant 3-4 seedlings per hole for varieties with male and female flowers on different plants. Seedlings should be placed at the same depth as they were growing previously.</li>
                <p>Newly transplanted seedlings should be watered regularly until they are established.</p>
                <h1>Cultural practices</h1>
                <h4>Weeding</h4>
                <p>Weeds are plants growing in undesired places. They compete with the target crop for growth factors like nutrients, sunlight, space and water, as well as harboring pathogens which directly affects performance of the crop.</p>
                <p>Spray CLAMPDOWN 480SL 150-300/20l, which is a non-selective herbicide used to control both broadleaved and grass weeds keeping the garden weed-free.</p>
                <h4>Irrigation</h4>
                <p>This should be done especially if rainfall is inadequate in order to ensure a steady supply of moisture and especially during flowering and fruiting stages.</p>
                <h4>Mulching</h4>
                <p>This helps in suppression of weeds and moisture conservation. Decomposed mulch materials release nutrients into the soil which are absorbed by the plants.</p>
                <div>
            <h1>Maturity, Harvesting & Post-Harvest Handling of Papaya</h1>
                    <p>Papaya plants start flowering 5-8 months after planting and fruits are ready for harvesting approximately 2 months after flowering stage. Maturity however depends on the variety. Harvesting is done by cutting off the fruit from the tree.</p>
                    <p>Note that fruits do not mature at the same time and thus only the mature ones should be harvested.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that fruits be harvested just before ripening.</p>
                    <p>Fruits should be handled carefully to avoid bruises which could create avenues for entry of storage pathogens.</p>
                    <p>The harvested fruits should be washed in order to remove any substances which could affect its shelf life.</p>
                    <p>Bruised or fruits with any damages should not be stored together with the good ones.</p>
                    <p>Ripe fruits are rich in vitamins and other nutritive elements and are commonly used for desserts or processed into other products.</p>
                    <p>Yields per tree vary from 30 to 150 fruits annually, giving 35 to 50 tons of fruit per ha per year. A papaya plantation can be productive for over 10 years but the economical period is the first 3 to 4 years. It is therefore advisable to renew the plantation every 4 years.</p>
