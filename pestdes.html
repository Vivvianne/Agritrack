            <h2>Pests</h2>
            <h3>Fruit flies</h3>
            <p>The adults deposit their eggs under the skin of mature and ripening fruit. Some fruit flies lay eggs on green pawpaw, but most of the eggs die due to the latex secreted when fruits are punctured by females while laying eggs. The eggs hatch into maggots which feed on the flesh of the fruit causing it to rot. This may cause fruit fall.
                </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Red spider mites</h3>
                    <p>They suck plant sap and this affects the general performance of the plant, e.g., poor plant growth, leaf drop, production of fruits with blemishes, etc.
                            Severe infestations occur during prolonged dry spells.
                            </p>

                <h3>Mealy bugs</h3>
                <p>They suck sap from tender leaves, petioles and fruits. Severely attacked leaves and fruits drop. They also excrete honey dew on which sooty mold develops.

                        </h3>
                        <p>These are sap-sucking insects which attack and puncture shoots, leaves and flower buds as they feed. Severe infestation can cause flower abortion.

                                </h3>
                                <p>These are white sap-sucking pests whose infestation causes curling and distortion of leaves and an eventually drop.
                                        They are also vectors of viral infections

                                    <p>They cause damage by feeding on shoots, leaves and fruits.
                                            As they feed, they release honey dew which facilitates the development of sooty mold.

                                        <p>These are small, microscopic wormlike parasites which feed on the plant roots resulting into formation of galls/swellings.
                                                Infestation may cause the plant to topple over due to declined vigour.

            <h2>Diseases</h2>
            <h3>Damping off</h3>
            <p>This is a soil borne infection which causes rotting of roots and stems leading to yellowing, leaf and fruit fall and subsequent death and toppling of the plant.</p>

            <h3>Papaya Ring Spot</h3>
            <p>This is a viral infection majorly spread by aphids or be mechanically transmitted. Infection causes mottling of leaves and vein clearing. In severe cases, the lobes of the leaves become distorted reducing the life size.
                    On the fruit, dark circles/rings are seen which remain green when the fruit ripens. Severely infected plants do not flower and die young.

                                Infection causes distortion of leaves and shoots. As the fruit develops, the white powder disappears leaving it grey-scared.
                                Premature fruit fall may occur.

        <h2>Nutrition And Nutritional Deficiencies
            </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Papaya nutrition is key for a year long high and quality fruit production.
                    Both basal and foliar fertilizers should be applied in order to ensure that the plants are supplied with both macro and micronutrient elements..
                    Basal fertilizers are absorbed by the plants through the roots and include DAP, CAN, NPK, UREA, among others. Farmyard manure could also be added, depending on the organic matter of the soil.
                    Foliar fertilizers are absorbed by the plants through the foliage and include OPTIMIZER, DIMIPHITE, ZINC GOLD, LAVENDER, GATIT SERIES, VITABOR GOLD, among others.
                    Sufficient nutrient supply prevent deficiencies which weaken the plants making them susceptible to attack by pathogens.
                    </p>

                            <p>Deficiency stops plant elongation and leaves become irregularly necrotic with a characteristic blue or dark green colour. Production is greatly reduced.

                                    <p>Leaf petioles become thin, short and compressed.  Stunted growth is noted with leaves becoming pale and reduced. These lead to decreased yields.
