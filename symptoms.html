        <h2>Damping off</h2>
          <p>This is a soil borne infection which causes rotting of roots and stems leading to yellowing, leaf and fruit fall and subsequent death and toppling of the plant.</p>

          <h2>Bunchy top disease</h2>
          <p>This is a viral infection spread by leafhoppers whose symptoms include oil streaks on stem, yellowing of upper leaves, bunching and stunting of top leaves and death of plant top.

                      <p>Deficiency causes interveinal yellowing and malformation of leaves, rosetting of leaves thus reducing photosynthetic area. Young plants may die off.
