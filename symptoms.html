        <h1>Symptoms</h1>
        <h2>Damping off
          </h2>
          <p>This is a soil borne infection which causes rotting of roots and stems leading to yellowing, leaf and fruit fall and subsequent death and toppling of the plant.</p>

          <h2>Bunchy top disease</h2>
          <p>This is a viral infection spread by leafhoppers whose symptoms include oil streaks on stem, yellowing of upper leaves, bunching and stunting of top leaves and death of plant top.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Leaf spot
              </h2>
              <p>Symptoms starts as small yellow spots which expand. In severe cases, the leaf drops. This greatly affects the performance of the plant.
                </p>

                <h2>Papaya mosaic
                  </h2>
                  <p>This is a viral disease spread by aphids, which is more serious on young plants. Leaves show symptoms of reduced size, patches of dark-green tissue alternating with yellowing to yellow-green.

                    <h2>Zinc deficiency
                      </h2>
                      <p>Deficiency causes interveinal yellowing and malformation of leaves, rosetting of leaves thus reducing photosynthetic area. Young plants may die off.
                        </p>
